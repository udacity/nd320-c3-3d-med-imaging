# In this exercise you will compute some of the performance metrics we have discussed
# Specifically, you will compute Sensitivity and Dice scores 
# between the ground truth for the volume from the previous lesson and the segmentation
# that your network had created. 
# Alternatively, there is a second, auto-generated segmentation available for you to 
# compare against
#
# Below we provide some starter code and put comments prepended with TASK to indicate 
# places where you need to fill in

    # TASK: Load segmentation masks from the nifti files in the folder data,
    # plus your own mask if you have created one in the previous exercise
    # spleen1_label_gt is the ground truth mask
    # spleen1_label_auto is the auto-generated one
    
    # <YOUR CODE HERE>
    # __SOLUTION
    lbl1 = nib.load("data/spleen1_label_auto.nii.gz").get_fdata()

    # __SOLUTION

    # TASK: Now, implement two similarity metrics - sensitivity (assuming that gt is the True mask)
    # and Dice Similarity Coefficient. 
    # Hint: the formal measure of "set cardinality" that is featured in DSC definition could
    # be computed as simply the volume of your 3D object
